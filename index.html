            <h1>História da Família</h1>
            <p>
                Tommy Vercetti was originally dispatched by the Forelli Family to Vice City to oversee a drug deal 
                funded by Forelli family money; the drug deal was supposed to be the beginning of the Forelli expansion down south towards Vice City.
                After the deal was ambushed by the Diaz Cartel, Vercetti was forced to start over with no money or property and aided only by Ken Rosenberg, 
                a bent lawyer with Forelli connections. He eventually killed the perpetrator of the drug deal attack, Ricardo Diaz, aided by his new friend Lance Vance.
                Following the demise of Ricardo Diaz, he received ownership of Diaz's mansion on Starfish Island, using it as his main base of operations, and subsequently 
                acquired various properties and businesses in the city, including a nightclub and porn studio. Tommy cut his ties with the Forelli Family, as his operation 
                Ricardo Diaz controlled a very lucrative protection ring across the island, prior to his death; on hearing of his passing, some of the stores in the North Point Mall were 
                refusing to pay for protection, which led Tommy to vandalize them, sending a message.
                Not too long after, Tommy drives a security firm out of Ocean Beach so that he can assume control of their protection racket at the Front Page Café, and eventually consolidates his control 
                over the lucrative protection ring by blowing up the Tarbrush Café at the North Point Mall along with Lance, while disguised as police officers.
                While building up his gang's illicit and legitimate businesses, Tommy also established ties with various criminals and gangs in the city, including the Cubans, Vice City Bikers, crooked property developer Avery  
                Carrington, and smuggler and narcotics trafficker Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez.
                Tommy's refusal to cut Sonny into the profits, however, prompted him to send collectors to Vice City in an attempt to "tax" his businesses, even going so far as to ordering his men to badly beat Earnest Kelly, 
                which resulted in Tommy killing all of the men that Sonny had sent to collect from his businesses.
                Following this, Sonny personally confronted Tommy at his mansion, and revealed that Lance had informed him about Tommy's plan to con Sonny with counterfeit money, which ultimately ended with Tommy killing 
                everyone at the mansion in a large shootout, including several Forelli gangsters, Lance Vance and Sonny Forelli.   
                Tommy claimed to be "untouchable" now in Vice City, as Sonny Forelli, the man who wanted him dead the most, had been killed in the massacre, and it was implied that with the death of their boss, the Forelli 
                Family would be weakened too much by his death to be able to send men to take care of Tommy. 
                Following Sonny's death, the Vercetti Gang is assumed to have total domination of Vice City. The Vercetti Gang, or at least Tommy Vercetti himself, is presumed to remain in power for an undisclosed time.
